                    The ice rink was made intentionally and used for the community but the school uses it as well. The rink is used for skating and hockey during the long winter months. The school teaches skating as part of the curriculum on this rink. In the spring months the rink is used for games like capture the flag, soccer and many others. I actually learned to skate here.

Previously the tennis court was used for students to learn racket games as a part of their curriculum in P.E. I have played tennis in this tennis court and balls are constantly getting kicked or thrown in there.

You use this app and login to your acount and you don't have to rememeber anything for all the information is already filled in for you. You pick a book you want to read ans press on a button that says, "Place Hold". Then you place the hold and the librarian will bring the book to you. After a book is returned to the library then they are quarantined until they can be checked out again.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The community park at the community of Lansdowne was renovated in September of 2020 and has been exciting for the residents in the community and Lansdowne school. The park is looking better than ever with new features that weren't on the old park, such as a zipline. I have been going to the old park since Grade 1 and this was renovated at the start of my Grade 6 year. The sand that used to fill the park has now been replaced with wood chips. The park has been renovated and is looking brand new. Sadly, no pictures of the renovated park has been uploaded online.</p>
